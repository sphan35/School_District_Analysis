# School_District_Analysis: Cleaning Data and making it more Fancy
## Overview of the School District Analysis
- The purpose of the School District Analysis was the utilization of Python code and Pandas data framing to address an error in data that arose due to academic dishonesty. The academic dishonesty resulted in the cleaning and editing of district data. The edits in School District data code were executed by: 
  - Replacing ninth-grade reading and math scores for students at Thomas High School. 
  - Providing a clean new written report of the School District data. Through analysis and implenting new code, updates were made to the many data summaries in this project.

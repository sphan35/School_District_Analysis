# School_District_Analysis: Cleaning Data and making it more Fancy
## Overview of the School District Analysis
- The purpose of the School District Analysis was the utilization of Python code and Pandas data framing to address an error in data that arose due to academic dishonesty. The academic dishonesty resulted in the cleaning and editing of district data. The edits in School District data code were executed by: 
  - Replacing ninth-grade reading and math scores for students at Thomas High School. 
  - Providing a clean new written report of the School District data. Through analysis and implenting new code, updates were made to the many data summaries in this project. 
  
## Results of the Analysis
- Affects on the District Summary

    - Before cleaning the data, Average Math Score, Average Reading Score, % Passing Math, % Passing Reading, and % Overall Passing were as listed below: ![](images/District_Summary_Before_Edits.png)
  - **After Data Edits**
    - After cleaning the data of invalid 9th grade math and reading scores from Thomas High School the Average Math Score, Average Reading Score, % Passing Math, % Passing Reading, and % Overall Passing were updated to: ![](images/District_Summary_After_Edit.png)
  - **Observation** : Upon adminstering a "new_student_count" that took into account the update of removing 9th grade students from Thomas High School from the total student count, a miniscule .1 decline in Average Math Score from 79.0 to 78.9, a .2 decline in % Passing Math from 75.0 to 74.8, a .1 decline in % Passing Reading from  85.8 to 85.7, and % Overall Passing falling .3 from 65.2 to 64.9.
